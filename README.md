# Underwater Corrosion Detection

This mini-project detects corrosion using a hybrid method:
- **pH sensor data** for water quality.
- **Image Processing** with a trained CNN model (Python + Google Colab) to classify objects as rusted or non-rusted.

## Techniques Used
- Google Colab (Python)
- OpenCV for image handling
- CNN for classification
- Hardware: pH Sensor
